## Scraping Tutorial

To scrape, Selenium is used. First step is to initiate the driver on firefox or chrome or whichever browser is preferred.
Then, driver.get() gets the argument as the url to be scraped. 
Then using the XPATH, or TEXT_LINK, the desired element through the inspector can be reached to and picked up for further processing.

For different websites, a different type of scraper is needed.
